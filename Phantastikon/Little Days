The tiny horizon is a little dirty sock.
It’s a speck of thread now to the shore 
of seaglass shards. 

And here: a firefly rises over a television 
commercial like a leaf swirling upwards 
towards the paper-thin moon.

Up, up, up, up, up, up, up			  
       up, up, up, up … 
       
A cloud of fingernails greets me,
my two eyes combine into a single wet honeycomb,
I’m sad, I’m mad, I’m sad, I’m mad,
my fingers become five wisps of thin hair,
I can no longer grasp little strands of sinking		
       moonlight.

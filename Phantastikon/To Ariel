The gyre gyres, a falcon squawks
the deafening tornadic sound
rips your mind in half
rips the Center into centers
mouth fills with iron mist
surely it all means something
that memory of dunes
the mirage of that disgusting Beast
vultures scattering
night dropping its veil for good
cradled now in free fall only
chanting shantih forever
forth

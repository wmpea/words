I dreamt of Huitzilopochtli wandering the morning shoreline.
I listened to his bare feet crunching in the seashells,
heard the jungle moaning in the wake
of his flight. 

I dreamt a hummingbird as locked in battle with two hawks:
I saw the feathers of its plumage plucked and fall,
watched the small bird beat its wings
into the dawn. 

I dreamt that mossy pathway where the prophet 
once on muddied hands did crawl, where now only bats lived,
the place whispered of in the villages
of our birth. 

I dreamt of a strange face,
I saw it as a statue’s gaze at the bottom of the sea. 
I saw gold coins glimmering by its toes
in the murky waters. 

And when finally I returned ashore 
Huitzilopochtli was gone, only his tracks being left. 
Already, the dusk had
begun—

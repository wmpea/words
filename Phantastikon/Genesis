There is a flower tree
at the origin of all things

a place where tassel plumes
hang like boughs from just air

blue petals fall to earth
creating a soft court

where rainbow-colored quetzals
oft wander through

here where the great silence 
is impenetrable by words

a silence encased by open jade 
a chamber far removed 

from the mouths
of all men.

His shadow in the river is massive, he will not stray 
far from its waters. He cloaks himself in the final yawn 
of the dusk that sinks behind the pines, 
then approaches. 

A child locks their window and waits upon the sill,
studying the tree line. Stars wake, night too yawns. 
The little one watches the forest: a firefly 
becomes a lantern. 

Upon his back he brings two satchels: one bearing plums,
one bearing fish scales. He is always hungry,
his eyes never close; he carries flames
in an invisible hand.

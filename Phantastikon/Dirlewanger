The dream is always the same
we are in Byelorussia 
and I sneak into the room where you are
sleeping
I come to your side and look down
at the ugliest face I’ve ever seen 
when I put my hands to your neck
a snake springs from the darkness and bites me
you wake and arise
I gasp at the two flames where your eyes should be
you close the gap and start to choke me
I choke you back
as snakes hiss us on we begin to hover
the floor beneath us disappears
wings sprout from your back 
an ocean materializes where the floor should be
the waters begin to boil
my vision wanes 
your expression doesn’t change
my strength leaves me, and now you are all 
that holds me up
I feel the hottest heat you can imagine
then everything goes dark: you drop me 
like trash into the redness

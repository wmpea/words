Tennessee was placed into a jar,
And strange it looked, upon a sill. 
It turned the distant world into a blur
Around that sill. 

And when the world leaned forth,
The blur swirled ‘round, casting ‘way its features. 
The jar was calm amidst the furor
And came to float within the sound. 

It became the center of reality. 
Yet the Tennessee began to crack. 
Piece by piece it disappeared
In the quiet nothingness within the jar.

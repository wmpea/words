Here a theater of Sun unwinds; lone,
salted, and revolving like
a top that was spun
by hands that were young, shifting out in
black space lighted by great Night—
among the Quadi at Gran’ua
as Aurelius might say,
we look and hope that we have vision,
hope our eyes have seen the true plots
that move time’s opulent scenes, scattered
happ’nings of man concentrically 
drifting outwards, and and and gawd pleads
what is the state of beauty in art
what is the state of beauty in man
it burdens me to look now on thee, ‘til
raising swords we start to war
‘gainst another like young heirs turned
out of fear of some throne, 
a fear of the power of kings: death
unfurls its ol’ eye in we, ‘las 
still a reminder time is but some glass; 
a shard that becomes many shards
breaking into glints of glitter
that ‘flect the world out into a trillion
small pieces, selves I see in 
all, countless bug-eyed gazes:
each looking as if they would 
close if only they could turn
wayward ‘gain, ‘yond the plot’s throes.

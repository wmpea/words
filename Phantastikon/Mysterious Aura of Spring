A little blossom blooms
just near a shadowed rock
a little blossom blooms 
here where the swallows flock 
and day unfolds, waking 
just near a shadowed rock 
as nightâ€™s frost is waning  
and butterflies are still 
and day unfolds, waking 
upon some dafodils 
which wait in sun for wind 
while butterflies are still,
while dawn meets its end 
in ancient blackened pines 
which wait in sun for wind 
in swathes of kudzu vines 
that little blossom blooms 
in ancient blackened pines 
that little blossom blooms.

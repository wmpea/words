into the fray
into the tick of slow clocks
glowing upon their mantles
into the long voyage of voices
into mother-of-godâ€™s milk glass

I had to
I had to do it
I had to go 

into a canoe through the last river
into an alphabet of the angels
writing itself upon my walls
into a scarlet world bathed in sugar
into a handful of fresh maggots

I had to
I had to do it
I had to go there.

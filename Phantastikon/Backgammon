Red eyes of the unbidden face.

Days silent and burst
spreading a haze,
tells of the bells that will ring new.

Alive now the shadow
slithers from the eggy dawn,
tells of the bells that will ring new.

Now to the nunnery
darkness for the light,
a madman looks west
to the blue-dipped-hills;
the wind stirs, to hail
foul weather on its way.

Lost in life in ceaseless warring;
with one eye open
in violence at the threshold

a new man at the threshold.

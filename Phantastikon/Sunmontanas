Amidst the Sunmontanas,
lo, the shaggy golden-eastern hills
all twisting riven with godblue creeks,
all riven with rolling obsidian streaks
so scarred that shade of heaven
as prey to the wanderings
of prometheusâ€™s ruby Dreams,
hillfires as dancers in and out
such valleys where now
yet a few pronghorns graze,
and them only occasionally gazing
up upon this babbling forth,
the empire-builder.

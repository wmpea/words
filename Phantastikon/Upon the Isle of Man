What child is this?

Spit forth from savage seas, a being
forgotten  of no memories, only infinite waves 
of blackness

Of the Pequod? Or a Phaeacian breeze
Godkissed? 

Awaken! 
Washed ashore beneath 
a white night             

as
if birthed up from the Maw
of Dreams,

from seas of darkness to weights of sight

a creature
rising from upon its knees, into 
position contrapposto:

                                            Ecce Homo—
Being of both 
                                         song and silence,
           of                           
                                         sempiternal dying,
           of                           
                                         war and peace,

is this Icarus  
                                         who plunged into the sea?

Who comes now clattering ashore, 
clattering and yakking the salt from his soul—

washed before an ancient moon, 
who, in eras come and gone, has glimpsed alas
a similar thing: 
                                         the hero‘s 
                                                           birth.

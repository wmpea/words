The young slave whispering 
in the generalâ€™s ear
you are only a man
your battle was a whimper
your parade is now passing
Rome is fraying like a cloth
the drunken crowds cheer
but the war is not over
lean, listen: you can already hear
the drums of Vandals marching
you are only a mutt
a dog who barks
at the fringe of battle
the young slave whispering
you are hardly a man

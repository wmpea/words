When mortals must dive for dreams
birthdays aren’t big
lovers who are total strangers stand by
all that’s distant pauses

the pasture of life begins
a grin without heaven
rosetrees sway in the stillness
dear lord, everything becomes myth

in sunlight a round face
no longer appears where one used to
the universe begins to fall asleep
twilight sinks in upon itself

echoes: a voice moans into the silence
and dost the kingdom come
the fragments of a mind shatter forth 
furled unto immensity’s dome.

willow boughs whirring
shoulders shouldering the world
I stroll the garden
to avoid the day’s mad goals
it is better now
in the hushed silence of sun
than in a room
where a man’s life must be done
here again I am
here again the birds now sing
I hear their soft songs
as if in the veil of dream
and like a wise child
I know in this moment’s turn
time cannot be lost
when there’s nothing here to earn

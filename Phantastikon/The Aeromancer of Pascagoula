The silhouettes of trees lean
Against the white night like a skydiver
Leans into air.  

Only black leaves dare bristle in the stillness.
Listen: a siren whoops in the distant heart
Of the unreal city. 

Every breath becomes a binge,
Every ant upon the ground multiplies
Into a thousand others. 

In a nearby room, a slow chromatic trill 
Is played upon a piano, 
No particular song.

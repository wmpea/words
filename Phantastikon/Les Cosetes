I am ten thousand little moons away.
Youâ€™ll know me by the small lobsters in my hands
and my crown conceived of mini-rivers.
From a dune I will break the tiny egg yolk horizon
thus to prepare our light breakfast for Hermes,
only to give him our message to the Gods:
Emperors of the little moons, Teachers of games,
your broken touch has made misty slaves of us;
we must now be broken further, like glass 
pounded into dust which is caught by the wind 
and spread into the invisible cracks of mountains; 
let us then mix with the water droplets that seep
from your sky, to harden into a million mini-selves.

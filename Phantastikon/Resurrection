When I died, the heavenly
Rhadamanthus rose and smiled:
William, turn and go home.

I didn’t ask questions.
I stepped down from the kingdom
using suns as stepping stones:
my longest evening.

Dreams rose past me while I hiked
like old balloons waiting to pop.
Some burst as they brushed ‘gainst my arms. 
My god, where were they going?

I returned to earth
and walked naked into a field of weeds. 
The mist of popped dreams 
sank softly upon my shoulders.

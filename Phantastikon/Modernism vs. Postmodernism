From between your teeth a flash of light bursts
out into the space between our faces,
so I kiss you like I’ve never before
and light spills out like swords between our lips

and the hairs on my body stand endwise 
as you whisper nothing comes from nothing
like a ghost ‘til I start to laugh and cry, 
light breaking into pieces in our pale hands

fresh wounds of pleasure and pain all the same 
we fall aground in blood and light and life
and begin to fuck like it’s our last time,
you screaming are you ready are you ready 

and in that moment god and truth shatter
into a trillion prickly glass shards, 
reflecting light into a trillion lights
which blinds us lame, what pure oblivion

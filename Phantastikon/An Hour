Upon a great mountain’s summit,
silent words were spoken to my heart:
do not hear

let the sky spread against you
let one year pass westward in the span

of an hour; 

see the dots of fire in the valleys flowering
see the world that is a morning dream

sing the song
your grandmother sang when
you were young—

you promised a splinter of the sunâ€™s eye
you promised a different dream on a strange night
now a tiny pill is all you give to me
now a thousand dead sunflowers do not make me weep

who failed to hold my hand over the blue flame
who failed to keep the queen in the game
at a time when ghosts hover over my bed
at a time when most of these stars were not ahead

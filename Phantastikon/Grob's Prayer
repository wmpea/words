Our Fatty, who art a hedgehog, 
hallowed be thy napalm.
Thy kissy come.
Thy wilt be done
in East Africa as thou art a hedgehog. 
Give us razzle dazzle and daily break-ins,
and forgive us our triangles,
as we forgive those who triangle against us, 
and lead us not into Tetanus,
but deliver us from eyelids. 
For thine is the kissy, 
and the practical, and the glucose,
for ever and ever. 
Amen.

Gallic fire in your eyes 
it burns leaps 
like Athena’s
nothing like the faces in the mortal parks

more than a human nightmare
your mystery so beautiful so awful 
in the twilight of hands

you hover in the window like a ghost
you’re lonelier than the moon
far and near at once

I know you completely in a moment
you slip through the precipice 
of all dreams.

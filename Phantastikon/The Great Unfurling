a conch falls 
from your mouth 
and lands upon a telephone book 
from 1996,
the year of our lord
and a girl or guy
sits quietly in the corner
watching or not watching the scene unfold,
smoking clove cigarettes
all the while
a golden scarab
lands at the open window
with a note taped to its back
you take the paper and realize 
it’s no note at all
it’s a photograph
a picture of you
at the beach in 1996,
a conch shell in your hands

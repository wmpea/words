He would lick the moon
for her and
kiss each
and every blade of grass

near her smile. He would sing
troubadour songs
in whistles
just to warn the forest

love was coming. And soon
a mockingbird imitates
his melodies
and so does another, and another

until it seems the entire forest
sings of her wonder
and she can hear
his love beyond words.

His nostrum came as a cliff.
When he arose, he was standing by a river. 
Deer were grazing.
The river flowed in silence,
the deer eating silently too. 
He tried to speak, but the words became
pebbles in his throat.
Near him a robin landed and laid an egg.
A one-eyed robin. A silent robin. 
He began to hear footsteps, the bodiless voice of his father. 
He smelled saffron. 
A green snake slithered up his shoulder
and started chewing on his eye.
Silently. 
He hears only steps now, one two, one two. 
He is the new prince of 
twilightâ€™s fog.

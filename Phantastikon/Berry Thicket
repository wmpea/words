In the sunless labyrinth of the berry thicket,
ten thousand thorns did kiss my flesh.
I became stuck in their kisses, 
stuck in their hands, never to be released 
from their fingers again.

I became an old man in that sunlessness;
I forgot my fingers, my feet, the eyes of my	face, 
the road by which I had once arrived
and the berries for which I had once came. 

I am now only a heaving chest
suspended in kisses, listening to the birds 
who sing from beyond the thicket, breathing 
like gods from soft throats, until one day 

they, too, fall silentâ€”
they, too.

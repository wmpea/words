cradled in a makeshift shelter
Creation looms some napping crescent;
freckles fall from the gods’ faces
as rain against the maker’s tent;
their eyes a tetrachromic green,
they reach their hands into its forest; 
they comb through vines and trees
until their fingers thump upon that mossy nest; 
they raise Creation upwards into heaven
and pin it down upon its chest;
say something, said Mars,
now let your words upon gods’ ears;
so poor Creation opened wide its mouth
and lo, a single persimmon fell out—

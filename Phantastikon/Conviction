In the hour of eyes a wall of white noise
sediments itself between blinks 
every which way
right and left ears redden
the weather is always excellent, always sad
someone in a desert faraway has died
someone in their seat shifts uncomfortably
someone on the subway says
if I was Brod, I would’ve burned them all
says again 
I would’ve burned every last gawdamn book 
and the sub stops and you step out 
onto a newspaper from today or last year
that bears a sovereign grinning face 
you do and do not recognize

across the street a homeless man screams
it was supposed to rain this morning
and with no thought, come and join him
it was supposed to rain this morning
it was supposed to rain
it was supposed to

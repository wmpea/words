He sings now into dawn’s floral swirls,
staying away from sad houses,
the rooms of men.

She dreams now into midday’s yellow smile,
taking naps in hammock whilst the world
blooms below. 

We walk now into dusk’s watercolor garden,
losing the sun and coming face-to-face
with statues of the dead. 

Be still now into night’s slow obsidian burst,
seeing how the constellations graze towards
wet grass at your feet.

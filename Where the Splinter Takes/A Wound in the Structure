something howls in Kathmandu
something with green eyes chucks high  
a golden towel 

angels or demons appear through
the partition of fingers where

a man brings 
a silent mire into the world
a woman moves 
like a cloak around a shadow

I throw in the golden towel

into the partition 
where the cloth is torn a thousand-fold

the wasted bodies rip
in unison or cacophony, depending
on the vantage

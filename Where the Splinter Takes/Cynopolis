The o-mikuji trees
shaken bare at the rim, the gates creek
Procrustes at the point
funneling souls into the stretch
hens and dogs upon the gates
girls and boys
hens and dogs
clack and lick beneath the Ixion
spin spinning with the clouds
above which whispers belie a Great Urge
a calumet in its left hand
an eagle in its right
the undisclosed peer welcomes all
citykind
(as they say, as they say)
faces break into the gated
bottleneck, coming out phantoms
on the other side

	Welcome
to Cynopolis, city of howls
the great neon billboard blinks
40 statues line the pink walkway
golden-haired, afroed
it matters who
no matter who

Grasshoppers rise from the asphalt into the silence
it smells of garlic, ginseng, cilicium
then an episode
empty jars spiked down upon the street
from laughing windows with 
faces inside them
the clay breaks at the feet of crucified Pauls and Peters
jackal heads for any neck
look around
there is no guide
but a guide approaches
no cloak or robe or skin
just a floating silly voice

Appleeye, it says

In the sleep banquets
the evil that sleeps like a cold dog
wakes grin-bearer
in corridor apples to nostalgia
cold, ice
the sweet walls crack to shards

as we hate and love

in the good brief
see sun
see shadow
where there are
no real eyes

the blink androidal
phantasmal
no need for wishing wells
old magic be dead
like the unborn dream
it never lived

to onyx Nothing, heed the prayer
we beg for dirt to mire the dead
we pray for mist to cloak the world

And when I look down
I am crucified, too,

two cardinals peck 
the wounds

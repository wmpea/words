The tower towers, it hangs like
goddamn. It moves, and everything moves.

Sunflowers bristle far off. Thereâ€™s
knee-high kids on a hill

playing in its shadow. What a time.  
You forget that was you. A terrible pain 

rises in your chest, the orange coal  
glows, the dream

comes on. You see Athena stab 
Janus in the mouth. He laughs out the blood,

he falls stupidly down. She looks at me
and smiles, I blush.

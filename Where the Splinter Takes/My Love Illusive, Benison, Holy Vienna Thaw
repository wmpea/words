anodyne dawn 
exonerates 
thru Vienna, ja, thru the hotel windows

thru the flitting partridge dance
beyond the Janus glass

the purple-orange 
dawn 

tells the long morning song; already
forgetting what dies at the end

I reach over and grab her hand
still wet from the
blow job

, two faces smile 

no hint of transcendence
nor irony

forgetting what dies at the end
the snowed-in world beyond waits 

old panes thaw
in the strange purple 
light

I set Baal’s severed head, silly-eyed, down 
on the cold marble; 
300,000 demons wince
and one cough becomes a million—
dost he prefer his gifts now, the princes laugh

Lucifer steps forward, 
a mirror in hand
Mammon steps forward,
a gold brick in hand 

to the beauty of justice
in the spirit of love

Asmodeus steps forward,
a whip in hand
Leviathan steps forward,
some wine in hand

to he who hath killed
in the name of light

Beelzebub steps forward,
salt in hand
Belphegor steps forward,
a crown in hand

to the new sun dawn’d
in the hellish vale

Satan steps forward,
66 legions at his back 
and, somehow, 
Baal steps forward

a new head 
in his hands

do feel guilty, Janus
do unto
garuda beaks the gate, coo coo 
in reek thru steel
Polybius carries basil leaves
and the peoples learn its taste
and Iucharba finds his weapon
and the Fong-hoang phoenix rises
and

we do not worship violence
but we understand destruction

like a trinket 	like a Panama City Beach
dollar shop souvenir
a pair of lips falls skydown
through the glass of the Louvre 

well, a version of the Louvre
right into my hands
hands that then turn to glass
semi-homicide

the flesh clouts in the subterranean light
this isn’t Paris, nor PCB
this is something unique, sear and ice
in the deepest nook 

of your heart’s city
look at me

it’s only necessary

look at me	track the eyes

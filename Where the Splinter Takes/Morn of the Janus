at Corfu  
, on the rock
something reassembled

   after
alles

with itself man hath
maketh
an 
example

and nothing stands
and nothing stands
and yet
and yet

dreaming I willâ€™d
parallels into golemic 
rock

behold god
this be
thine glory in stone

I 
share it with you
, milord

flock hither 
    flock hither
    
in your golden
	sun

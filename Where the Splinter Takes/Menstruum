so many bones to sick
white white so ahead the mouth
hang low 
titter collects like smoke 

samfie, crook 

the expectation
the glass

I was sad but 
now I’m happy

I’m happier 
yes
I reheat coffee 

before the morning
yellows out

I was sad but now I’m happy, yes, 
I’ll reheat a coffee, sit by the window,

sometimes I hold
my breath

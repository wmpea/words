Liao’s friend in Greece hunts for Dazzling Bright Vision.
	Liao’s friend in Greece shivers in a moonlit hostel.
	Liao’s friend in Greece dreams Athena mounts his cock. 
	Liao’s friend in Greece wakes to gin and tonic. 
And, right then, everything in the universe surrounds that room. 
So Liao’s friend in Greece hums the same song over and over. 
Liao’s friend in Greece flicks a cigarette onto the terrace. 
Suddenly it’s dusk, he’s in the middle of the street. 
The road before him, glowing gold, begins to rise into the air. 
Liao’s friend in Greece turns around and texts his brother. 
This isn’t the light I thought I’d see. 
And I haven’t forgotten what you asked of me. 
What if I said to expect me at three?
Thus Liao’s friend in Greece 
                     hunts for Dazzling Bright Vision …

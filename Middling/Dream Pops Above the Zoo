Janus zings
darts thru the doorway
he burps and
1,000 years of sadness pass

we laugh and sip
liquid burgers
in the world's dumbest museum
below

this is love
we're anointed in death
we're an exhibit as
darts ping us on the head

from the fringe
from the threshold
ants pass and gods cough
around the excellent meat

in city of blue haze
weak for magic
i balcony lean
at last bar in the dark bay

i la and la and la some more
years and storms pass
yet nothing changes the night
i lean into the dream and fall thru

i realize there is no balcony
i'm adrift on a boat 
in a moonless bay
watching a blueness from afar

i raise my cutlass
like a torch on the sea
some dart whizzes over my shoulder
toward the hidden shore

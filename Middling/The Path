take away the heat and the living
not the rotten body I enjoy
not while the invisible bird above is still singing 
the song will not stop 
respect and shame
cut from star to star
a hot day becomes night 
the light always shines close to the forest 
stroll through the wall 
cover your face and smile about something 
ask small, curious questions
does it hurt? Did you misbehave?
can I do it?
eyes black with anxiety and sadness
the last bag of beer
death awaits us
the hotel is empty and quiet 
i am learning a sense of upright living 
i am in danger. I am the lust of the flesh
itâ€™s sad
yet the terrible night doesn't frighten me

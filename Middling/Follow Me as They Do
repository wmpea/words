in love among walking portraits
utopia arriving in golden clouds
i rove stolen 
thru 1,000 sunset fiestas

silly faces giggle the way
a sort of spring hits
someone in the pollen haze says
truth gives us death

mask comes off
plums fall into my open hands
every other one
bursts into mists of glass

and nothing hurts
i confess poems to that giving dusk
one last monster shrugs forever
in the distance

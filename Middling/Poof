nowhere to nowhere feeling the opposite of longing
i stood still for 10 years
and awoke under a highway when heaven fell on us

and eternal spring arrived
and the alien gap in my heart opened dumbly
like a fishâ€™s mouth on shore

and the devil entered my prayers and i felt nothing
but the world as one window
and a cold wind coming in

i pose like a statue
smile like i mean it
become an angel
and my peace sign splits the world

in half in a nest
in a movie
a goddess spins philosophy
in a smoky bedroom i've never seen before

suddenly i'm young again
i flower in a rainbow nightscape
and walk from bar to bar
to kill time

i flick my wrist and earth catches on fire
i flick it back
and i'm with a woman i don't know
taking midnight shots to flee the morning

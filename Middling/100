And watch I down for all eternity a mention
Save the terrible machine
The utter ask
From Marathon with doves
Paper skin down into the darkness and don't stop breathing
Lay back for King Scalpel 

Between the freaks let's drink my silly wine
Imagine a million tears 
Who would notice?
Life's modes swing through us
We can be the gods we didn't want to know
It's a decent view in the valley

Winking at the edge under the luck sun to the crossing
Wayward to the shiver
I levitate not
Not being able to break through the tangled time
I lay down in the light
Out of the flowers

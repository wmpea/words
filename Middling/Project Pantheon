PROJECT PANTHEON
On the sojourn,  the Great Suicide,     dream-addicts 
coil snake-eyed at the heart of “the spectacle 
of Poesy”
opening fresh fury in old sound deferred 
opening in the millennium rift 
bastards bitches
Odysseus-wandering 
in rebellion the Great American Rooftop,  
flip-flopping prophets 		
in the paragon Boredom shine, jazzed
into the Lazarus reave 
with and against the karma-gangsters, 
spirited into flesh, 
we are become parrots
of a million Blackbeards all at once,
filling the dharma holes
and making new dharma holes wherever we go, 
benumbed,
sight-seeing America dazed and pushed up
against doom’s Wall, 
seeing the evolution of ancient tragedy 
bearing new fleurs du mal, 
love becoming a glorious abomination 
in the garden of national madness
here raiders of the Buzz have come 
and lain 
a gargantuan black jukebox 
like a shrine at the maw of Wall Street, 
	the Avenue du Bliss,
and the ghost of Crassus rises in fascist mist
taking one ear 
while the ghost of Pompey takes the other
they would have us think 
we’re all Caesars now
when we’re just motel reapers, listeners  
of the trumpet’s squaw opening the dawn
blinking in the daylight’s admonishment  
as the Fire is coming		collecting every song you love
your quick sojourn twists
like a dove

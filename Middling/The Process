I rove the country
bringing magic tricks for sale,
new coins for new debts

People await me
dressed in nice clothes in town squares
with bored blinking eyes ...

I climb atop steps
and stare out upon the crowds,
then raise my wand high

And always I float 
(toward light I don’t understand)
‘til folks clap happ’ly on

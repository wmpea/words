unicorns rip
across the hill
we laugh from faraway 
what's this world become

i point an arrow at the sun
friends laugh me off
i mend in the absence
and tilt toward an odd star

i hang on
and watch the horns
dance across the way
i saw what shouldn't be seen

am i strong?
i pull the bow 
as hard as i can
i hesitate for a century

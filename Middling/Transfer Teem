in a dream tower
in dim room
              overlooking
                black sea and sunless haze

an empty cup levitates
in midair
before my fingers

a lone faraway horn
cuts thru
the dark shore's droning
the quiet world's misting

in the drowning distance
a wave 
the size of a city
collects
until Janus sneezes in my head

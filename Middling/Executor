lost in Cora’s voice, soon weeping 
i dreamt of our dark city; i saw its lights 
when I shouldn’t have

i gained 10,000 faces
and learned punches and mirrors
and port from port
and realized i was no one 

i learned this poem’s from 2009 
and yet it’s a room no one’s seen before
i levitated over myself
and did things i didn’t understand

i awoke in London
next to 1,000 pages 
i don’t remember writing
addressed to myself, hey friend

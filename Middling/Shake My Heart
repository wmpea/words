on the inside looking out
i want to hold you like i never knew you
and sleep in while the city groans on

and next our rooms become buildings
and then they become countries and worlds
and meanwhile i’m holding you

and this new morning begins
and you’re hurting and so is everyone around you
and the sun breaks in like lava, my god

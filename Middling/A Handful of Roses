In the doorless room a doorbell rings
a statue of Napoleon tips
against the wall
and its mouth screams 
like hell but the stone doesn’t break 
the ceiling just rips ajar, the wallpaper 
of Michelangelo’s Separation 
splits in four
its curled corners
giving way to the purple sky above
where slow and ant-like
a Cessna crawls, dumb banner whipping

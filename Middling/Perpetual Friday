under rainclouds
ungazing
Janus slips into poetry
the master of beer and piss

collecting darts 
world's edge
jars of sweet sauce mounting
behind him

we play his game
we phantoms
in walled cities
lo bright shapes in long flames

too emotional
pacing in small rooms
it's all good
we look out at the full April moon

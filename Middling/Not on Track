the idea works, Linda was crying again
there was a voice in my throat and a sudden stop
thoughts at the crossroads
Cheonan blinks like 1,000 little stars 
hope
a road winds between trees
an earthquake, and another, rock on rock
a bird suddenly cries out
the sound of rain starts, and it stops immediately 
sweat, look at everything 
the game is completely changed
i lay in bed next door and look at us 
toe to toe
we’re 1,000 mirrors 
we lay naked and laugh at each other
resting in the heat of the night
eyes bloodshot from insomnia 
unknown seas of knowledge 
my face lights up, my lips part 
i’m a hammer in the woods
scars on the head as white as lightning 
resisting pollution
mind falling back to shore, falling to knees
my little lips form words 
the white horse raises its head

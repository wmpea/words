twig-mouthed lark for now 
songless
still flies curving earth 
still eyes still songs 
within its breast enwinged 
its work can only
postpone new melodies 
for so long 
before throat again 
will have its play
again again the music comes
again this jazz will have 
its day 
and the high lark goes   
knowing nothing 
, its instinct only 
cries the way

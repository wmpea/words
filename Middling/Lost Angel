day's never day
thru open doors 
the weight of not lifting wings 
in unreal afternoons rises

a fever
a vision
Janus kisses me six times
with red hot spears

i sleep in the fire
and fly away in the smoke
music bursts out
then i wake up in a dream

a half-god falls
thru the black egg's shell
it's me
it's not me at all

i’m mystified by you and the soft bite of rebirth
i fall asleep over and over
running away from the red flowers and everything else

a powerful lord enters my dreams
it’s myself enrobed 
in fine jewels and fine threads and we dance together

then i wake up 
and i’m unified in the echoing morning 
and ghosts i once could hear i no longer can

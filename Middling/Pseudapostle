I lost all thirst sharding hearts into coal.
I de-winged over Marrakesh.
I dragged my sword out of heaven and fell to earth.
I limped into the Red City with a red cloak.

I licked my burns in midnight shadows.
I pulled my chest apart and looked for love.
I felt odd prophecies lap upon my mind like storm waves.
I wrung out the old lords in quakes and gasps.

I became a human in that darkly dirt.
I moved my lips and light poured from my mouth. 
I made a mask with my ragged cloak. 
I looked up and saw stars Iâ€™d never seen before. 

I fell asleep and dreamed I was an eagle.
I awoke blinded by the new sun.  
I stood and prepared to blend in with the world.
I limped out into the long, odd street.

father i stood 
on the highest hill
and with glass eyes
i saw your gates ajar in the city 

i split in two:
one half to help the folks there
and the other to track 
the nearing enemy troops

my first self pulled
an arrow from the sunâ€™s light
and a great bow appeared
in hand

i took aim 
and shot the ray into the horde;
when the blast blinked out 
your gates thus closed anew

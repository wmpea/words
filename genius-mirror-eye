slug-faced it’s coming down
it’s a calculus of madness 
Tarkovsky’s working on a Soviet sci-fi in hell
they found Mars laying in his own vomit, well 
the fucked thrill of infrarrealismo reopens 
again and again
	like cuts 
on the arm of the rebellion 
Chet and Rahim laying like dead men on the porch
Sunseanian, wet like leaves in an August thaw
wond’ring who will be 
the next great poet 
wond’ring what is the law 
of G-spot orgasms, Continental and Analytical chasms 
the ghost of Rimbaud arises the maw
ni templos ni jardines 
will save you now 
so Imago lifts the brow	who is the ferryman of dead thru life
the money is not yet free
cringe videos on YouTube perforate the veil
mystical is who crosses the threshold into nothing
who has crossed the city AND the village 
the whistles and silence of the fellow humankind 
and gone beyond wondrous enraged green eyes 
into conch-turned-obelisk life 
who has crossed the crimson salamander
and been welcomed
	into Club Charon
	where Antonius Block
	and Squire Jöns are taking a pause  
before going to sleep for 1,000 years 
and dreaming of a madhouse with an infinite lawn
surrounding a massive, sky-flirting
strawberry
there is a new Bastille
and we sit in our apartments listening to jazz
waiting for destiny to reveal over tea and Spiritus Mundi 
the party beyond partying	the quiver of modern poetry that’s a scream 
I want to hear you scream 
like you’ve been thrown into a stream 
like daily life has disappeared
who will go beyond utopia is a real 	unreal monster indeed
